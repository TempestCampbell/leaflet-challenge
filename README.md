## Description

Utilizing both html and Javascript help to visulaize the earthquake data from the the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in a meaningful manner for the general public. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. Data is chosen from the [USGS website](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and is already given in geoJSON format. I chose to visualise earthquakes of the magnitude of 4.5 or more within the past 30 days.
